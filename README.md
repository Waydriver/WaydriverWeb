# Waydriver Web

Waydriver is a cutting-edge task management system. For more info about it,
visit the project's [main page](https://github.com/Waydriver).

This repository contains the code for the frontend, which is written with
TypeScript, using NextJS and MaterialUI.

## Running the frontend

## Running the backend

1. `git clone` the project
2. `npm install`
3. Sort out a configuration file or something, I haven't planned this yet
4. `npm run dev`

### Running in production

I haven't thought about this yet, check back later. I might put together a nice
Docker system or something.

## This is a work in progress

I'm planning to continue working on this in my spare time. Currently, it is not
in a workable state. Hopefully it'll be ready to try out soon!

## Roadmap

These are the things I'm hoping to tackle on the frontend, in no particular
order:

* [ ] Auth and stuff
* [ ] Dashboard
* [ ] Page for displaying and editing projects
* [ ] Nice system for inputting task details
* [ ] Nice UI for creating a plan (arranging tasks into a todo list)
* [ ] Clean interface for when you're actually working, to avoid distractions
* [ ] A better state management system that isn't jank (eg Redux?)

I'm not sure where I'll go from there - this project is primarily designed to
match my own needs for a task management system, so after I've got the basic
stuff working, I'll add things as I see fit.
